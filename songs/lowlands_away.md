title: Lowlands Away
---

<!-- [Verse 1] -->
I dreamed a dream the other night\
[Lowlands, lowlands away, me John]{.chorus}\
My love, she came, dressed all in white\
[Lowlands away]{.chorus}\

<!-- [Verse 2] -->
I dreamed my love came in my sleep\
[Lowlands, lowlands away, me John]{.chorus}\
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep\
[Lowlands away]{.chorus}\

<!-- [Verse 3] -->
She came to me at my bedside\
[Lowlands, lowlands away, me John]{.chorus}\
All dressed in white, like some fair bride\
[Lowlands away]{.chorus}\

<!-- [Verse 4] -->
And bravely in her bosom fair\
[Lowlands, lowlands away, me John]{.chorus}\
Her red, red rose, my love did wear\
[Lowlands away]{.chorus}\

<!-- [Verse 5] -->
She made no sound, no word she said\
[Lowlands, lowlands away, me John]{.chorus}\
And then I knew my love was dead\
[Lowlands away]{.chorus}\
